## Project Overview
The SuperStore US Power BI Dashboard project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Transformation**: The raw SuperStore US data is transformed into a suitable format for analysis. This includes merging datasets, handling missing values, and structuring the data for visualization.

2. **Cleaning Process**: Data cleaning techniques are applied to ensure the data is accurate and reliable. Outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies are addressed to improve the quality of the analysis.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**: The transformed and cleaned data is then used to create an interactive Power BI dashboard. Visualizations, charts, and insights are presented in a user-friendly manner.

## Data Transformation
In the "Data Transformation" phase, we perform tasks such as:
- Merging different datasets (sales, customers, products, regions)
- Extracting relevant features for analysis
- Creating calculated columns and measures
- Ensuring data consistency and format

## Cleaning Process
The "Cleaning Process" includes:
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal
- Identifying and addressing outliers
- Resolving duplicate entries
- Standardizing data formats

## Power BI Dashboard
The heart of the project is the Power BI dashboard. It showcases various visualizations and insights, including:
- Sales trends over time
- Geographic distribution of sales
- Product performance analysis
- Customer segmentation
- And more...

## Getting Started
